🔍 AxionRay Automotive Data Analysis – Root Cause Insights & Taxonomy Mapping
This project focuses on deep semantic analysis of warranty and repair data from the automotive domain, aimed at identifying root causes, symptom conditions, and component-level failures through structured tagging and insight extraction.

📌 Key Highlights:
✅ Data Taxonomy Design: Developed and applied a custom data tagging framework to convert unstructured text into structured categories.

✅ Semantic Analysis: Extracted critical root causes and failure patterns using Python, mapping them to predefined taxonomy tables.

✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation: Cleaned and processed a 50+ column dataset using pandas, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

✅ Insight Extraction: Identified high-cost repairs, failure clusters, and temporal trends in TOTALCOST, REPAIR_DATE, and other key metrics.

✅ Visual Analytics: Proposed visualizations to support decision-making and highlight financial impact areas.
